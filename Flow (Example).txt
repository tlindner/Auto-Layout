One sided
#
# Flow documents always start with "One sided", or "Sheetwise".
#
# Flow lines: Top to bottom, left to right, bottom to top, right to left
# can be set in any ordered desired, but must be matched pairs.
# Flow lines contain two values:
# 1. A count of columns or rows.
# 2. An angle to rotate the page.
#
# The first flow line is the primary direction, and the second is the
# secondary direction.
#
# Gutters must also be listed in pairs and contain a list of gutters
# to be put between the pages. If the system runs out of gutters
# during auto layout, it will start over at the begining of the list.
#
# The first gutter line is for the primary direction, and the second
# gutter line is for the secondary direction.
#
# Pages lines contain five values.
# 1. The name of the CSV file that contains a list of pages.
# 2. The column name that contains the PDF file name.
# 3. The column name that contains the page number in that PDF.
# 4. The column name that contains the quantity desired of that page.
# 5. The bleed distance in the PDF.
#
# Each page will be stepped and repeated.
